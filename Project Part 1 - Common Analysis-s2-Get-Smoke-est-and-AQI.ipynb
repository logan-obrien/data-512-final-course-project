    "Our next task is to create a smoke estimate.\n",
    "First, I consider what will I allow for my range of values. According to airnow.gov, the AQI index ranges from 0 to 500, where 0 is the cleanest air and 500 is the worst [10]. Now, because the assignment requires me to compare my smoke estimate to the AQI information from the EPA, I would like to try to encourage a similar range for most of my estimates. \n",
    "\n",
    "Next, I consider what factors I want to be incorporated into my smoke severity estimate. The assignment instructions provide several helpful ideas saying \"It seems reasonable that a large fire, that burns a large number of acres, and that is close to a city would put more smoke into a city than a small fire that is much further away.\" After giving it some thought, I will base my estimate off 1). each fire's size, measured in the number of acres burned, and 2). its distance from Richland as calculated earlier above.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's think about each of these factors, starting with acres burned. Now, it makes sense that my smoke estimate should be increase for larger fires and decrease for smaller fires, all else being equal. Additionally, a fire closer to Richland should result in poorer smoke conditions than a fire far away. Taken together, these two factors are at odds with each other, and so I decided to take their ratio for my smoke estimate - yielding: ***acres_burned / distance_from_city***.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several more changes to make to this estimate to improve it a bit. First, we can convert the acres burned to square miles burned so that the numerator and denominator have the same units. As an aside, the resulting units are now 1/mi, and to be honest I am not sure how to think about a smoke estimator with a unit attached to it, so for the sake of this assignment, I will not concern myself with the estimate's units. \n",
    "\n",
    "While designing my estimator, I revisited the course lecture notes from 10-30-23 and looked at the professor's findings from his exporatory data analysis. According to lecture, about 94% of all fires are between 0 and 5000 acres (approx. 7.8 square miles), but the largest was 1.4M acres (approx. 2,100 square miles). In contrast, the distances I will consider will be no greater than 1,250 miles from Richland. Because the majority of these areas burned are small relative to the distances, I added a scaling factor to the numerator so it will be weighted more evenly, by multiplying by 100. \n",
    "\n",
    "I also wanted to reduce the frequency of more extreme values in my smoke estimates, and so I enforce a heuristic that the minimum distance a fire can be from the city is 1 mile, and that any fire closer than that is treated by the estimate as 1 mile. Simillarly, I enforce a minimum size of burned area (0.5 square miles). Lastly, I want to ensure my estimate has a minimum value greater than 1, so I take the argmax of the expression and thus my final estimate is:\n",
    "$$argmax(\\frac{\\text{(square_mi_burned * 100)}}{\\text{distance_from_city}}, 1)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "If the result is 1, then I assign the corresponding smoke estimate to 'None' so that when I later take an annual average of the estimate, it will ignore those entries. I do this because otherwise there are a lot of entries with a value of 1 and I want the variation in my estimate to be more noticable.\n",

    "Below is the function I defined to calculate my smoke estimate."

    "Now, my classmate, Emily Rolen, recommended I select the larger AQI value of pm10 and pm2.5 for my overall AQI value for each day, and I like this idea. Based upon my exploratory work earlier into the 0002 Site sensor, we know that the pm10 detector has an open date of 2019-04-01, while the pm2.5 acceptable has an open date of 2005-10-19. Based upon this info, let's find the max AQI and store it. To accomplish this task, we will loop through every day in the date range and check if the data dictionaries have a key corresponding to that date. We set the start date to 1985 because earlier in the notebook we can see that the api calls did not provide data successfully prior to that year."
